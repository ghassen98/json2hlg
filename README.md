# json2hlg
Javascript Json/GeoJson To Hlg converter
The HLG format is used by SasPlanet to define an area selection. I had my proper administrative delimitation and i want to download some imagery layer over those delimitations. This tool will simply convert Json/GeoJson files to HLG format.
The size of the uploaded file must not exceed 200 Ko ; Otherwise simplify the geometry.
The GeoJson type of geometric objects must be Polygon.
